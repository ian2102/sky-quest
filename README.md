In Sky Quest, you start by skydiving into the battlefield and strategically selecting your landing spot. The game features a dynamic 64x64 voxel-based map, which is procedurally generated to ensure a unique experience with every session.

Your main objective is to collect all five hidden blue balls scattered throughout the map. Navigate the environment carefully, avoiding bouncing red balls that can cause immediate death and restart the game. Use your left-click to send a ball in the opposite direction, providing a defensive tactic against these hazardous red balls.
